# Domain of One's Own Web Map Hosting Tutorial 

To follow this tutorial you will need:

1. *A Domain of One's Own Account* (for help setting up your account, go to [this Ask Athena article](https://askathena.brynmawr.edu/help/domain-of-ones-own-get-started))
2. *Exported leaflet webmap from QGIS* (follow [this qgis2web tutorial](https://www.qgistutorials.com/en/docs/3/web_mapping_with_qgis2web.html) until step 30). 


## Log into Domain of One's Own
Once you have your exported qgis2web files in one folder save on your computer, zip all the files into one folder. This zipped folder will be uploaded to your domain. The exported project should contain an index.html file, as well as other folders including css, js, legends, markers, webfonts, images and data. Once you have all your files in order, log into your Bryn Mawr Domain of One's own account. 

## Scroll down to the File Manager on DoOO
